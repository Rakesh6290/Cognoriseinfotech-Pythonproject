//1.Calculator Project:
Installation:
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Introduction:
The Calculator project aims to create a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations. Users can input two numbers and choose an operation, and the calculator will perform the calculation and display the result.

//Working Process:
Prompt the user to input two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
Perform the selected operation on the input numbers.
Display the result to the user.
Output:
Here's an example output of the Calculator project:

Welcome to the Calculator App!
//OUTPUT:
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1

10 + 5 = 15

// 2. Sudoku Solver:
// Installation:
1.There is no installation required for this project. You just need Python installed on your system.
// Introduction:
2.The Sudoku Solver is a Python program that can solve Sudoku puzzles using backtracking algorithm.
Sudoku is a popular number puzzle game where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
// Working Process:
3.The program takes an incomplete Sudoku grid as input.
4.It applies a backtracking algorithm to fill in the empty cells with valid numbers (1-9) while ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains no repeated numbers.
5.If a chosen number leads to a contradiction, the program backtracks and tries a different number.
6.It continues this process until the puzzle is solved or determines that no solution exists.
// Output:
The output of the program is the completed Sudoku grid, if a solution exists.
If no solution exists, the program will indicate that there is no solution for the given Sudoku puzzle.
// 3.Password Generator:
// Installation:
You can install the required libraries using pip: pip install random
// Introduction:
The Password Generator is a Python program that generates strong and random passwords based on user-specified length and complexity.
// Working Process:
The program prompts the user to specify the desired length of the password.
It generates a password using a combination of random characters (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters).
The generated password is displayed to the user.
// Output:
The output of the program is a randomly generated password of the specified length.
// 4. Hangman Game:
// Installation:
There is no installation required for this project. You just need Python installed on your system.
// Introduction:
The Hangman Game is a Python program that allows users to play the classic word guessing game.
// Working Process:
The program selects a random word from a predefined list of words.
It displays an empty hangman figure and underscores representing the unguessed letters in the word.
The user guesses letters one by one.
If the guessed letter is in the word, it reveals the positions of the letter in the word.
If the guessed letter is not in the word, it adds a part to the hangman figure.
The game continues until the user correctly guesses the word or runs out of attempts.
// Output:
The output of the program is the hangman figure, the partially revealed word, and feedback to the user (e.g., correct guess, incorrect guess, game over).
// 5. Countdown Timer:
// Installation:
There is no installation required for this project. You just need Python installed on your system.
// Introduction:
The Countdown Timer is a Python program that counts down from a specified time.
// Working Process:
The program prompts the user to specify the desired duration of the countdown timer.
It starts the countdown timer and displays the remaining time.
Once the countdown reaches zero, it notifies the user that time is up.
// Output:
The output of the program is the countdown timer displaying the remaining time.
// 6. Dice Rolling Simulator:
// Installation:
There is no installation required for this project. You just need Python installed on your system.
// Introduction:
The Dice Rolling Simulator is a Python program that simulates rolling dice.
// Working Process:
The program prompts the user to specify the number of sides on the dice and the number of rolls.
It generates random numbers for each roll and displays the results.
// Output:
The output of the program is the results of rolling the dice, showing the outcome of each roll.
